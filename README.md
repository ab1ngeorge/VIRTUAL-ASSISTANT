# VIRTUAL-ASSISTANT
Developing a voice assistant in Python using neural intents for natural language understanding and intent classification. Model trained on preprocessed dataset and integrated with SpeechRecognition and PyAudio to perform various actions based on user inputs, enhancing user experience.

The software requirements in this project include:
â€¢ Python
â€¢ Speech recognition
â€¢ Natural Language Processing (NLP)
â€¢ Machine learning 
â€¢ Development environment

Project is a voice assistant that can perform a variety of tasks such as playing music, telling jokes, providing weather information, reading news articles, and more. It uses speech recognition to understand user input and responds with synthesized speech output. The assistant also has a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with it using text inputs and displays the assistant's responses.

The program is written in Python and uses various libraries and APIs for speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, web scraping, and other functionalities. It utilizes multithreading to handle simultaneous user inputs and outputs, and it can save user preferences and data to a local file.

In addition to the core functionalities, your assistant can also be customized and expanded with new features, such as natural language processing (NLP) for better understanding of user inputs, machine learning for personalized recommendations, and integration with external servicesÂ andÂ devices.
